#Antibody stuff
#Have added something to make sure antibodies work in right dilutions and sample number (they can be too dilute or concentrated to mix with the dilutant).
#Have mentioned that if antibody volume to add is <30uL, then you need to add the single channel p20, otherwise add p300. we can just run the code with the p300 installed, as most dilutions required this. nevertheless, we've covered all possibilities regarding antibody volumes.
